# BankAccountApp
This app reads from a csv file which contains a person's name, ssn, balance, and the type of account (checking or savings), and creates a randomized account number, randomized safety deposit box id and safety deposit key (if the account type was savings), and randomized debit card number along with the pin number. There's an example csv file to test with.
